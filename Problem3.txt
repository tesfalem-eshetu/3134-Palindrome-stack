in this read me file i will be analyzing the actual runtime value For
each method. for the sake of comparison i will be using the same n value
across the methods

trial 1, n = 2
cubic = 1,484,544 ms
exp = 31,344,263 ms
constant = 1,162,511

 even with small number as 2, we can see significant difference 
 between exp and the others 

 trial 2, n= 5
 cubic = 11,352,943
 exp = 35,819,772
 constant = 951,459
 here same thing happened like the previous one , but as expected the 
 cubic one have now increased significantly from its previous trail 

 trail 3 , n =50
 cubic = 9,349,493,187 
 exp =does n't seem like to finish till the heat death of the universe
 constant = 1,162,820


 from this we can see that for the exp the running time seems like 
 to be infinity, which drives home the fact that exponential time 
 complexity are the worst of all.
 we can notice that the constant time doesn't show significant
 difference.while on the contrary although better than the exp the 
 cubic also increases significantly.
